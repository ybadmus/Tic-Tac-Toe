## Rules for Tic-Tac-Toe
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You are x, your friend (or the computer in this case) is o. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie. 


## Usage instructions

- The first player will be prompted for an input on the board using numbers between 1 and 9.
- After the selection, the updated board will be displayed with the placed "x".
- Now the second player will be prompted for an input on the board using numbers between 1 and 9 but only the available positions.
- After the selection, the updated board will be displayed with the placed "o".
